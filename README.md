Welcome to FSE (FastScriptEditor) 1.0

This tool is designed to speed up the scripting process in ROM hack development by translating proprietary FSE code (documentation found in "ref.txt") into standard XSE code.
There are several benefits to scripting this way rather than with XSE directly, with the main ones being that you're only going to be writing about 1/2-2/3 the amount of code, 
as well as the fact that FSE comes pre-loaded with plenty of data tables. In other words, rather than having to look up a pokemon or item ID in a big table, you can simply put
the name of the item and FSE will find its ID for you.
